# Portfolio Backtester

The Portfolio Backtest Suite is a collection of tools for backtesting stock and ETF portfolios using historical data. Similar to [Portfolio Visualizer](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio) but this will eventually be a fully open source, programmatic, and customizable platform.

## Initial Goals

- Build a mechanism for collecting historical price data
- Build a system for running portfolio backtests and experimenting with different settings
- Build a mechanism for creating and testing new "artificial" funds
